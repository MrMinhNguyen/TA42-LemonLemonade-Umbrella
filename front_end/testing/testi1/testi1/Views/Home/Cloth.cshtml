                            <p>
                                One of the simplest ways to protect your skin is to choose clothing or use an umbrella which absorbs or blocks harmful UV radiation.
                                Clothing and an umbrella with UPF labelings are great barriers between the sun’s UV and your skin, but clothing can better protect your skin as it gets closer to skin.
                            </p>

                            <p><strong> What is UPF? (Ultraviolet Protection Factor):</strong></p>
                            <p>
                                UPF is a measurement of the sun protection strength of clothing and fabrics used in outdoor shades.
                                It represents the ratio of UV radiation exposure with and without the protection of the measured textile.
                                The higher the UPF the stronger the protection against the sun.

                            <h3> How to choose the right materials to protect your children from UV: </h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Coverage: choose long sleeves, skirts and pants which can cover more skin so that you have better protection. </li>
                                <li>Weave – The tighter the fabric structure, the less UV radiation passes through, the better the sun protection. </li>
                                <li>Color – Dark colors absorb ultraviolet rays more strongly than the lighter shades on the same fabric, which increases sun protection。</li>
                                <li>Weight – The heavier of the same fabric, the lesser UVR it can against. </li>
                                <li>Stretch – The greater the stretch or tension put on a textile, the lower the UPF rating. </li>
                                <li>
                                    Water – When some fabrics have absorbed water, they will provide less protection against UVR,
                                    such as polyester and cotton. Choosing a fabric that provides effective protection from UV but dries quickly will help
                                    minimise the effect of moisture.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Washing – Cotton-based fabrics tend to shrink after the first washing, thereby tightening the weave and reducing the transmitted ultraviolet radiation.
                                    So old, threadbare or faded clothes may offer decreased protection over time.
                                </li>
                                <li>Additives – UVR stabilizers or additives can be added to a range of textiles to improve their sun protection. </li>
                                <li>Layering – Increasing UV protection by layering materials and clothes is a good idea. </li>
                                <li>UV absorbers – Some clothing has been modified to absorb more UV light. </li>
                                <li>Check the label on your clothes to check if they've been treated, and then follow the care instructions. </li>
                            </ul>

                            <strong>Note:</strong>
                            Try to cover as much skin as possible with cool, loose-fitting clothing made from densely-woven fabric like cotton.
                            If your child is wearing a singlet top or a dress with thin straps, remember to layer them with a t-shirt or a shirt before going outside to play.
